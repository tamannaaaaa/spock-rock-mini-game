Spock Rock Game
Welcome to the exciting world of Spock Rock Game! This is a fun and challenging two-player game inspired by the classic rock-paper-scissors game but with an added twist of two extra choices: Spock and Lizard. The game is a test of your strategic thinking and intuition as you try to outsmart your opponent.

How to Play
1. Objective: The objective of the game is to win a certain number of rounds (typically best of three or best of five) against your opponent.

2. Choices: Each player can choose one of the following gestures:

Rock
Paper
Scissors
Spock
Lizard
3. Rules: The gestures follow these rules:

Rock crushes Scissors and crushes Lizard
Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock
Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard

Round Outcome: After both players have made their choices, the round's outcome is determined based on the rules. One player wins the round, or it can be a tie if both players choose the same gesture.

Winning the Game: The game continues until one player reaches the set number of rounds won (best of three or best of five). The player with the most rounds won is declared the winner.
